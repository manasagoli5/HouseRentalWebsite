# HouseRentalWebsite
The goal of this project is to construct and design a complete database model for an apartment leasing website. The goal is to create a data model for a marketing/rental property that can handle several properties. The goal of this project is to create a market/rental property administration service that allows users such as property owners to advertise properties for rent and for users looking for a place to rent to find the information of the house or room and be able to look at it (request a tour) and book it. Property owners and tenants are likely to utilize this website. This website offers services such as creating a listing and searching for it , view the property description and images, rate the property, get a tour, and book the property The detailed page also includes information such as the house's price, photograph, and brief description. Similarly, the admin user can manage the residences that they have listed. They may quickly add new houses, edit existing ones, or eliminate them.
